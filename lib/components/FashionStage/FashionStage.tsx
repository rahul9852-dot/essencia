            Fashion has been a part of human culture for centuries. In ancient
            times, people used to dress up in different styles to distinguish
            themselves from others. In the Middle Ages, fashion was a symbol of
            social status and wealth, and only the elite could afford the
            luxurious fabrics and accessories.

            During the Renaissance era, fashion became more elaborate, and the
            use of accessories such as hats, gloves, and jewelry became popular.
            In the modern era, fashion has become more accessible to people of
            all social classes.
